# Sentiment analysis overview

After a simple preprocessing, we will test different approaches for 
the sentiment analysis problem, including:
- Padding sequences, training word embeddings, test optimizers, applying RNN 
archictures, bi-directional RNNs and regularization.
- Bag of Tricks, from this [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759)
- Convolutional Neural Networks for multi-class sentiment analysis
